# List of Rake tasks
The list of Rake tasks.

If you want to confirm all Rake tasks from command line interface, you can run the following.

```sh
bundle exec rails rake -T
```

**General usage note:** Remember that each command will be invoked in a particular environment (configuration, database). The default environment when nothing is specified is "development". In production, you usually prepend all commands with `RAILS_ENV=production` to opt into the production environment. This is not necessary if you're using the Docker images, because that environment variable is set in the image for you. Similarly, prepending `bundle exec` is not necessary when using Docker. The following invocations are equivalent:

Standalone: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake mastodon:users:admins`  
Docker: `docker-compose run --rm web rake mastodon:users:admins`

Furthermore, in the command, `rake` is interchangeable with `rails`
