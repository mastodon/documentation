## Available libraries

There are several libraries to interact with the Mastodon API. The list of libraries can be found on the [Libraries page](Libraries.md).

___

## Notes

###### Parameter types

When an array parameter is mentioned, the Rails convention of specifying array parameters in query strings is meant.
For example, a ruby array like `foo = [1, 2, 3]` should be encoded in the params as `foo[]=1&foo[]=2&foo[]=3`, with empty square brackets.

When sending binary data, such as files, Mastodon expects clients to use the `multipart/form-data` MIME type. This applies to media attachments, account avatars and account headers.

###### Selecting ranges

For most `GET` operations that return arrays, the query parameters `max_id` and `since_id` can be used to specify the range of IDs to return.
API methods that return collections of items can return a `Link` header containing URLs for the `next` and `prev` pages.
See the [Link header RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) for more information.

###### Errors

If the request you make doesn't go through, Mastodon will usually respond with an [Error](#error).

To crop intelligently, focal points can be used to ensure a certain section of the image is always within the cropped viewport.

| Attribute                | Description                        | Nullable |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `id`                  | ID of the filter | no       |

| `context`                  | Array of strings that indicate filter context. each string is ont of 'home', 'notifications', 'public', 'thread'  | no       |
| `expires_at`                  | String such as "2018-07-06T00:59:13.161Z" that indicates when this filter is expired.  | yes       |

| `whole_word`                  | Boolean that indicates word match.  | no       |

If `whole_word` is true , client app should do:
- Define 'Word constituent character' for your app. In official implementation, it's [A-Za-z0-9_] for JavaScript, it's [[:word:]] for Ruby. In Ruby case it's POSIX character class (Letter | Mark | Decimal_Number | Connector_Punctuation). 
- If the phrase starts with word character, and if the previous character before matched range is word character, its matched range should treat to not match.
- If the phrase ends with word character, and if the next character after matched range is word character, its matched range should treat to not match.

Please check app/javascript/mastodon/selectors/index.js and app/lib/feed_manager.rb for more details.
Most case client apps are compared to WebUI(JS), they should obey to JS implementation.
