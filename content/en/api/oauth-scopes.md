## OAuth Scopes

The API is divided up into access scopes. The scopes are hierarchical, i.e. if you have access to `read`, you automatically have access to `read:accounts`. **It is recommended that you request as little as possible for your application.**

Multiple scopes can be requested at the same time: During app creation with the `scopes` param, and during the authorization phase with the `scope` query param (space-separate the scopes).

{{< hint style="info" >}}
Mind the `scope` vs `scopes` difference. This is because `scope` is a standard OAuth parameter name, so it is used in the OAuth methods. Mastodonâ€™s own REST API uses the more appropriate `scopes`.
{{< /hint >}}

If you do not specify a `scope` in your authorization request, or a `scopes` in your app creation request, the resulting access token/app will default to `read` access.

The set of scopes saved during app creation must include all the scopes that you will request in the authorization request, otherwise, authorization will fail.
