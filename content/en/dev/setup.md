### Pre-requisites {#prerequisites}

You can follow the [pre-requisites instructions from the production guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/), but do not create a `mastodon` user. You also don't have to install `nginx`, `certbot` and `python-certbot-nginx` as the development environment brings its own webserver. Setting up and running a development environment has been proven successful over WSL2 as well if you are on Windows.

### Setup {#setup}

Run following commands in the project directory `bundle install`, `yarn install`.

In the development environment, Mastodon will use PostgreSQL as the currently signed-in Linux user using the `ident` method, which usually works out of the box. The one command you need to run is `rails db:setup` which will create the databases `mastodon_development` and `mastodon_test`, load the schema into them, and then create seed data defined in `db/seed.rb` in `mastodon_development`. The only seed data is an admin account with the credentials `admin@localhost:3000` / `mastodonadmin`.

> Please keep in mind, by default Mastodon will run on port 3000. If you configure a different port for it, the generated admin account will use that number.

If `rails db:setup` gives you the Postgres error:

    ActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError: FATAL:  role "your_user_name" does not exist

(where `your_user_name` is your username), then run:

    sudo -u postgres createuser your_user_name --createdb

This will create the necessary Postgres user with the permission to create a database.

### Running {#running}

There are multiple processes that need to be run for the full set of Mastodonâ€™s functionality, although they can be selectively omitted. To run all of them with just one command, you can install Foreman with `gem install foreman --no-document` and then use:

```text
foreman start
```

In the Mastodon directory. This will start processes defined in `Procfile.dev`, which will give you: A Rails server, a Webpack server, a streaming API server, and Sidekiq. Of course, you can run any of those things stand-alone depending on your needs.

### Testing {#testing}

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `rspec` | Run the Ruby test suite |
| `yarn run test` | Run the JavaScript test suite |
| `rubocop` | Check the Ruby code for conformance with our code style |
