## Quick start with Vagrant {#vagrant}

For convenience, the Mastodon repository includes a Vagrantfile for quickly setting up a development environment without manual configuration. To use this development environment, install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) using a binary executable or through your package manager.

Once you have Vagrant installed, for convenience, it is recommended to install a plugin to automatically update your machine's hosts file. This will allow you to access the dev environment at `http://mastodon.local` without manually editing the hosts file yourself. To do so:

```sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
```

The virtual machine can then be started:

```sh
vagrant up
```

Once the virtual machine has been started, you may launch the Foreman task executor to launch the various Mastodon processes:

```sh
vagrant ssh -c "cd /vagrant && foreman start"
```

Once the Mastodon processes have fully started up, you can load `http://mastodon.local` in your browser to access the Mastodon instance within the VM. You can log in as the default admin user with the username `admin@mastodon.local` and the password `mastodonadmin`.

Any changes to the source code will be reflected after saving your files.

To reset the VM to a fresh state, you can destroy it and bring it up again:

```sh
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
```

## Manual install from source {#manual}

You can follow the [pre-requisites instructions from the production guide]({{<relref "admin/install">}}), but do not create a `mastodon` user. You also don't have to install `nginx`, `certbot` and `python-certbot-nginx` as the development environment brings its own webserver. Setting up and running a development environment has been proven successful over WSL2 as well if you are on Windows.

### Setup {#setup}

Run the following commands in the project directory:

```sh
bundle install
yarn install
```

In the development environment, Mastodon will use PostgreSQL as the currently signed-in Linux user using the `ident` method. Ensure that you have created a Postgres user and database for your current signed-in user:

```sh
sudo -u postgres createuser $YOUR_USERNAME_HERE --createdb
```

You can now create the databases `mastodon_development` and `mastodon_test`, load the schema into them, and create seed data defined in `db/seeds/` into `mastodon_development`.

```sh
rails db:setup
```

You can now launch `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and log in with the default admin user (`admin@localhost:3000` / `mastodonadmin`).

{{<hint style="warning">}}
By default, Mastodon will run on port 3000. If you configure a different port for it, the generated admin account will use that number as well.
{{</hint>}}

### Running {#running}

There are multiple processes that need to be run for the full set of Mastodonâ€™s functionality, although they can be selectively omitted. To run all of them with just one command, you can install and use Foreman:

```sh
gem install foreman --no-document
foreman start
```

This will start processes defined in `Procfile.dev`, which will give you: A Rails server, a Webpack server, a streaming API server, and Sidekiq. Of course, you can run any of those things stand-alone depending on your needs.

## Preparing to run tests

Prep the test database:

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test ./bin/rails db:setup
```

Generate test-mode precompiled assets:

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test NODE_ENV=tests ./bin/rails assets:precompile
```

## Useful commands for testing {#testing}

`rspec`
: Run the Ruby test suite

`yarn run test`
: Run the JavaScript test suite

`rubocop`
: Check the Ruby code for conformance with our code style

## Updating your development instance {#update}

`bundle install`
: Update Ruby gems and install any new dependencies

`yarn install`
: Update Javascript packages and install any new dependencies

`RAILS_ENV=development rails db:migrate`
: Run new database migrations for your development instance's database
