If you believe that you've identified a [security vulnerability](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/vulnerability) in Mastodon, we encourage you to submit the bug to us privately for [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). We do **not** recommend that you report such issues publicly on GitHub or in other public spaces, until we've had time to publish a patch for the issue without exposing Mastodon's users to increased risk. Should you choose to coordinate disclosure, we may credit you for your discovery, and financially reward you in proportion to the severity of the issue through our [OpenCollective fund](https://opencollective.com/mastodon).

{{< hint style="info" >}}
A "vulnerability in Mastodon" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through [one of our public source code repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/mastodon/repositories?q=visibility%3Apublic%20archived%3Afalse%20-fork%3Atrue). Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given Mastodon instance installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that Mastodon instance. To find a Mastodon instance's contact information, visit their respective `/about` page.
