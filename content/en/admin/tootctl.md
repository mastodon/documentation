The command-line interface of Mastodon is an executable file called `tootctl` residing in the `bin` directory within the Mastodon root directory. You must specify which environment you intend to use whenever you execute it by specifying the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable. Unless you are a developer working on a local machine, you need to use `RAILS_ENV=production`. If you are sure that you will never need another environment \(for development, testing, or staging\), you can add it to your `.bashrc` file for convenience, e.g.:

```bash
echo "export RAILS_ENV=production" >> ~/.bashrc
```

If so, you wonâ€™t need to specify it each time inline. Otherwise, calls to `tootctl` will usually go like this, assuming that the Mastodon code is checked out in `/home/mastodon/live`:

```bash
cd /home/mastodon/live
RAILS_ENV=production bin/tootctl help
```

## Base CLI

{{< caption-link url="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/lib/cli.rb" caption="lib/cli.rb" >}}

### `tootctl self-destruct` {#self-destruct}

Erase this server from the federation by broadcasting account Delete activities to all known other servers. This allows a "clean exit" from running a Mastodon server, as it leaves next to no cache behind on other servers. This command is always interactive and requires confirmation twice.

No local data is actually deleted, because emptying the database or deleting the entire VPS is faster. If you run this command then continue to operate the instance anyway, then there will be a state mismatch that might lead to glitches and issues with federation.

{{< hint style="danger" >}}
**Make sure you know exactly what you are doing before running this command.** This operation is NOT reversible, and it can take a long time. The server will be in a BROKEN STATE after this command finishes. A running Sidekiq process is required, so do not shut down the server until the queues are fully cleared.
