The command-line interface of Mastodon is an executable file called `tootctl` residing in the `bin` directory within the Mastodon root directory. You must specify which environment you intend to use whenever you execute it by specifying the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable. Unless you are a developer working on a local machine, you need to use `RAILS_ENV=production`. If you are sure that you will never need another environment (for development, testing, or staging), you can add it to your `.bashrc` file for convenience, e.g.:

```bash
echo "export RAILS_ENV=production" >> ~/.bashrc
```

If so, you wonâ€™t need to specify it each time inline. Otherwise, calls to `tootctl` will usually go like this, assuming that the Mastodon code is checked out in `/home/mastodon/live`:

```bash
cd /home/mastodon/live
RAILS_ENV=production bin/tootctl help
```

---


### `tootctl self-destruct` {#self-destruct}

Erase this server from the federation by broadcasting account Delete activities to all known other servers. This allows a "clean exit" from running a Mastodon server, as it leaves next to no cache behind on other servers. This command is always interactive and requires confirmation twice.

No local data is actually deleted because emptying the database or deleting the entire VPS is faster. If you run this command and then continue to operate the instance anyway, then there will be a state mismatch that might lead to glitches and issues with federation.

{{< hint style="danger" >}}
**Make sure you know exactly what you are doing before running this command.** This operation is NOT reversible, and it can take a long time. The server will be in a BROKEN STATE after this command finishes. A running Sidekiq process is required, so do not shut down the server until the queues are fully cleared.
{{< /hint >}}

`--dry-run`
: Print expected results only, without performing any actions.

### `tootctl domains crawl` {#domains-crawl}

Crawl the known fediverse by using Mastodon REST API endpoints that expose all known peers, and collect statistics from those peers, as long as those peers support those API endpoints.

---


### `tootctl media remove-orphans` {#media-remove-orphans}

Scans for files that do not belong to existing media attachments, and remove them. Please mind that some storage providers charge for the necessary API requests to list objects. Also, this operation requires iterating over every single file individually, so it will be slow.

`--start-after`
: The Paperclip attachment key where the loop will start. Use this option if the command was interrupted before.

`--dry-run`
: Print expected results only, without performing any actions.

`--prefix`

: String `username@domain` handle of the account

`--domain DOMAIN`
: FQDN string

`--status ID`

### `tootctl preview_cards remove` {#preview_cards-remove}

Remove local thumbnails for preview cards.

`--days N`

`--verbose`
: Print additional information while task is processing.

---


### `tootctl search deploy` {#search-deploy}

Create or update an Elasticsearch index and populate it. If Elasticsearch is empty, this command will create the necessary indices and then import data from the database into those indices. This command will also upgrade indices if the underlying schema has been changed since the last run.

`--batch-size`
: Defaults to 100. A higher batch size can make Elasticsearch process records more quickly, with less load on the PostgreSQL database, but can increase memory pressure on the Elasticsearch nodes during indexing.
