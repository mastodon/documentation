User-uploaded files can be stored on the main server's file system, or using an external object storage server.

By default, Mastodon will store user uploaded and federated media files on the server's file system, under `public/system` in its installation directory and the files are served at `https://example.com/system`.

{{< hint style="info" >}}
While using the server's file system is perfectly serviceable for small servers with a handful of users, using external object storage is more scalable.

## Configuration Options

### Backend Variables

These variables specify how Mastodon connects to your backend S3 storage provider. While AWS is mentioned as the default, Mastodon can work with various providers like AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, MinIO, Exoscale, Scaleway, OVH, or any other S3-compatible provider.

Consult your provider's documentation for help in setting up these options correctly.

#### `S3_ENABLED`

Must be set to `true` to enable S3 storage.

**Default:** `false`

#### `S3_BUCKET`

The name of the S3 bucket at your provider.

**Default:** _None_

#### `S3_REGION`

The S3 region where your bucket was created.
Used to help construct `S3_ENDPOINT` when using AWS, but not required by other providers.

**Default:** `us-east-1`

#### `S3_ENDPOINT`

The specific S3 target where Mastodon connects to perform API operations.
Used in conjuction with `S3_REGION` when using AWS, but should be specifically set when using other providers.

**Default:** `s3.<S3_REGION>.amazonaws.com`

#### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

Effectively this is the API username for the S3 provider.
This is created/assigned to you by your S3 provider.
Despite the name it is not AWS specific.

**Default:** _None_

#### `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Effectively this is the API password for the S3 provider.
This is created/assigned to you by your S3 provider.
Despite the name it is not AWS specific.

**Default:** _None_

{{< hint style="info" >}}
The access id/key must provide Mastodon the ability to write data to your S3 bucket.
You must also set up your S3 bucket to ensure that all objects are publicly readable, but only writable or listable with proper authentication.
Consult your provider documentation for assistance.
{{</ hint >}}

### Client Access Variables

Once S3 file storage is enabled, Mastodon will provide new URLs for all media 'read' operations.
These URLs can be accessed using plain HTTP GET methods, without requiring authentication.
This means that they can be routed and/or cached through reverse proxies and CDNs.

{{< hint style="info" >}}
Remember to serve the files with proper CORS headers, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, to ensure media visibility in the user's browser and proper functioning of Mastodon's web UI.
{{</ hint >}}

It is highly recommended to use a domain (or subdomain) that you control for delivering S3 stored media.
This provides flexibility in case you decide to change S3 providers in the future.
By properly configuring the URLs, you can hide the usage of the storage provider and use caching to reduce egress bandwidth costs.
It also ensures that the address for your file storage, which may have already federated to other servers for older posts, remains accessible even if you need to change the storage provider's address.

Some S3 providers, such as DigitalOcean Spaces, provide integrated CDN/caching services as part of the S3 service.
For others, you will need to configure this manually or partner with another provider.

{{< page-ref page="admin/optional/object-storage-proxy.md" >}}

#### `S3_ALIAS_HOST`

Instead of using an address like `https://s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/example-mastodon-bucket/image.jpg`, you can configure it to be delivered from something like `https://files.example.com/image.jpg`.
In this example, `S3_ALIAS_HOST` would be set to `files.example.com` and constructed as shown:

- If `S3_ALIAS_HOST` is not set, then the media access URL will be `<S3_PROTOCOL>://<S3_HOSTNAME>/<S3_BUCKET>/<object path>`
- If `S3_ALIAS_HOST` is set, then the media access URL will be `<S3_PROTOCOL>://<S3_ALIAS_HOST>/<object path>`

**Default:** _None_

#### `S3_PROTOCOL`

Generally should not be changed from the default of HTTPS.

**Default:** `https`

#### `S3_HOSTNAME`

Required if not using AWS S3 and `S3_ALIAS_HOST` is not set.

**Default:** `s3-<S3_REGION>.amazonaws.com`

### Additional Variables

Due to the large number of S3 provider options, but inconsistencies in how they implement the S3 API, there may be some tuning required specific to your implemention.

#### `S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION`

The signature version used to authenticate and authorize requests to the S3 provider.

**Default:** `v4`

#### `S3_OVERRIDE_PATH_STYLE`

Set this to `true` if the storage provider requires API operations to be sent to `<S3_BUCKET>.<S3_ENDPOINT>` (domain-style).
Only used if `S3_ENDPOINT` is also configured.

**Default:** `false`

#### `S3_OPEN_TIMEOUT`

The number of seconds before the HTTP handler should timeout while trying to open a new HTTP session.

**Default:** `5`

#### `S3_READ_TIMEOUT`

The number of seconds before the HTTP handler should timeout while waiting for an HTTP response.

**Default:** `5`

#### `S3_FORCE_SINGLE_REQUEST`

Set this to `true` if you run into trouble processing large files.

**Default:** `false`

#### `S3_ENABLE_CHECKSUM_MODE`

Enables verification of object checksums when Mastodon is retrieving an object from the storage provider. This feature is available in AWS S3 but may not be available in other S3-compatible implementations.

**Default:** `false`

#### `S3_STORAGE_CLASS`

When using AWS S3, this variable can be set to one of the [storage class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html) options which influence the storage selected for uploaded objects (and thus their access times and costs).
If no storage class is specified then AWS S3 will use the `STANDARD` class, but options include `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`, `GLACIER`, and others.

**Default:** `STANDARD`

#### `S3_MULTIPART_THRESHOLD`

The maximum size (in megabytes) of objects that will be uploaded in a single operation.
Objects above this threshold will be uploaded using the multipart chunking mechanism, which can improve transfer speeds and reliability.

**Default:** `15`

#### `S3_PERMISSION`

Defines the S3 object ACL when uploading new files.
When using an S3-compatible object storage backend, it is recommended to use a backend with ACL support, as it allows Mastodon to quickly improve the security of private data.

**Default:** `public-read`

{{< hint style="danger" >}}
Use caution when using [S3 Block Public Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html) and turning on the `BlockPublicAcls` option, as uploading objects with ACL `public-read` will fail (403).
In that configuration you should set `S3_PERMISSION` to `private`.
{{</ hint >}}

#### `S3_BATCH_DELETE_LIMIT`

The official [Amazon S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObjects.html) can handle deleting 1,000 objects in one batch job, but some providers may have issues handling this many in one request, or offer lower limits.

**Default:** `1000`

#### `S3_BATCH_DELETE_RETRY`

During batch delete operations, S3 providers may perodically fail or timeout while processing deletion requests.
Mastodon will back off and retry the request up to this maximum number of times.

**Default:** `3`

## Provider Specific Configurations

### MinIO

MinIO is an open-source implementation of an S3 object provider.

{{< hint style="info" >}}
Installing MinIO is outide the scope of this documentation, but this should show how to configure a bucket for use in Mastodon.
{{</ hint >}}

You need to set a policy for anonymous access that allows read-only access to objects contained by the bucket without allowing listing them.
To do this, you need to set a custom policy (replace `mastodata` with the actual name of your S3 bucket):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mastodata/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Mastodon itself needs to be able to write to the bucket, so either use your admin MinIO account (discouraged) or an account specific to Mastodon (recommended) with the following policy attached (replace `mastodata` with the actual name of your S3 bucket):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mastodata/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can set these policies from the MinIO Console (web-based user interface) or the command-line client (`mcli` / `mc`).

#### Using the MinIO Console

Connect to the MinIO Console web interface and create a new bucket (or navigate to your existing bucket):
![](/assets/object-storage/minio-bucket.png)

Then, configure the “Access Policy” to a custom one that allows read access (`s3:GetObject`) without write access or the ability to list objects (see above):
![](/assets/object-storage/minio-access-policy.png)

{{< hint style="info" >}}
If the MinIO Console does not allow you to set a “Custom” policy, you will likely need to update MinIO.
If you are using MinIO in _standalone_ or _filesystem_ mode, [`RELEASE.2022-10-24T18-35-07Z`](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-10-24T18-35-07Z) should be a safe version to update to that does not require [an involved migration procedure](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/migrate-fs-gateway.html#migrate-from-gateway-or-filesystem-mode).
{{< /hint >}}

Create a new `mastodon-readwrite` policy (see above):
![](/assets/object-storage/minio-mastodon-readwrite.png)

Finally, create a new `mastodon` user with the `mastodon-readwrite` policy:
![](/assets/object-storage/minio-mastodon-user.png)

#### Using the command-line utility

The same can be achieved using the [MinIO Client](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html) command-line utility (which can be called `mc` or `mcli` depending on where it is installed from).

Create a new bucket:
`mc mb myminio/mastodata`

Save the anonymous access policy from above as `anonymous-readonly-policy.json` and the Mastodon user access policy as `mastodon-readwrite.json` (make sure to replace `mastodata` with the name of your newly-created bucket).

Set the anonymous access policy for your bucket:
`mc anonymous set-json anonymous-readonly-policy.json myminio/mastodata`

Add a `mastodon-readwrite` policy:
`mc admin policy add myminio mastodon-readwrite mastodon-readwrite.json`

Add the `mastodon` user (replace the password):
`mc admin user add myminio mastodon SECRET_PASSWORD`

Apply the `mastodon-readwrite` policy to the `mastodon` user:
`mc admin policy set myminio mastodon-readwrite user=mastodon`

### Wasabi Object Storage

Create a new bucket and define its policy to allow objects to be anonymously readable but not listable:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mastodata/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

![](/assets/object-storage/wasabi-access-policy.png)

{{< hint style="info" >}}
If you are using an old bucket, ensure you are not giving “Everyone” read access to objects through Wasabi's legacy Access Control settings, as that allows listing objects and take precedence over the IAM policy defined above.
{{< /hint >}}

Then, create a `mastodon-readwrite` policy to grant read and write access to your bucket:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mastodata/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

![](/assets/object-storage/wasabi-mastodon-readwrite.png)

Finally, create a new `mastodon` user and don't forget to enable the `mastodon-readwrite` policy:
![](/assets/object-storage/wasabi-mastodon-user.png)

On Mastodon's side, you need to set `S3_FORCE_SINGLE_REQUEST=true` to properly handle large uploads.

### DigitalOcean Spaces

In your DigitalOcean Spaces Bucket, make sure that “File Listing” is “Restricted” to users with access keys.

![](/assets/object-storage/do-spaces.png)

### Scaleway

If you want to use Scaleway Object Storage, we strongly recommend you create a Scaleway project dedicated to your Mastodon instance assets and use a custom IAM policy.

First, create a new Scaleway project, in which you create your object storage bucket.
You need to set your bucket visibility to "Private" to not allow objects to be listed.

![](/assets/object-storage/scaleway-bucket.png)

Now that your bucket is created, you need to create API keys to be used in your Mastodon instance configuration.

Head to the IAM settings (in your organization menu, top right of the screen), and create a new IAM policy (eg `mastodon-media-access`)

![](/assets/object-storage/scaleway-policy.jpg)

This policy needs to have one rule, allowing it to read, write and delete objects in the Scaleway project you created above (the scope).

![](/assets/object-storage/scaleway-policy-rules.jpg)

Then head to the IAM Applications page, and create a new one (eg `my-mastodon-instance`) and select the policy you created above.

Finally, click on the application you just created, then "API Keys", and create a new API key to use in your instance configuration.
You should use the "Yes, set up preferred Project" option and select the project you created above as the default project for this key.

![](/assets/object-storage/scaleway-api-key.png)

Copy the Access Key ID and Secret, and use them for your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` Mastodon config variables.

### Exoscale

In Exoscale, your bucket should not have any read ACLs (Mastodon will set the ACLs on the object themselves as appropriate).

You need to create an API Key for the Mastodon app, restricted to the Object Storage (`sos`) service, restricted to your bucket, and with unrestricted operations.

![](/assets/object-storage/exoscale.png)

On Mastodon's side, you need to set `S3_FORCE_SINGLE_REQUEST=true` to properly handle large uploads.

### Cloudflare R2

Cloudflare R2 does not support ACLs, so Mastodon needs to be instructed not to try setting them.
To do that, set the `S3_PERMISSION` environment variable to an empty string.

{{< hint style="warning" >}}
Without support for ACLs, media files from temporarily-suspended users will remain accessible.
{{< /hint >}}

To get credentials for use in Mastodon, select “Manage R2 API Tokens” and create a new API token with “Edit” permissions.
