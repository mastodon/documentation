{{< hint style="warning" >}}
This page documents API endpoints that are not finalized. We welcome feedback on them and you are free to implement them, but we recommend not having these implementations in a release, as they are likely to change and we will not ensure backward compatibility if they do.
{{</ hint >}}

This page is about grouped notifications, which we implemented server-side so that:
- grouping is consistent across clients
- clients do not run into the issue of going through entire pages that do not contribute to any new group; instead, notifications are already deduplicated server-side

The API shape is a bit different from the non-grouped notifications, because large notification groups usually tend to involve the same accounts, and moving accounts to a root key can avoid a lot of duplication, resulting in less server-side work and smaller network payloads.

## Get all grouped notifications {#get-grouped}

```http
GET /api/v2_alpha/notifications HTTP/1.1
```

Return grouped notifications concerning the user. This API returns Link headers containing links to the next/previous page. However, the links can also be constructed dynamically using query params and `id` values.

Notifications of type `favourite` or `reblog` with the same type and the same target made in a similar timeframe are given a same `group_key` by the server, and querying this endpoint will return aggregated notifications, with only one object per `group_key`. Other notification types (such as `follow`) may be grouped in the future.

Types to filter include:
- `mention` = Someone mentioned you in their status
- `status` = Someone you enabled notifications for has posted a status
- `reblog` = Someone boosted one of your statuses
- `follow` = Someone followed you
- `follow_request` = Someone requested to follow you
- `favourite` = Someone favourited one of your statuses
- `poll` = A poll you have voted in or created has ended
- `update` = A status you boosted with has been edited
- `admin.sign_up` = Someone signed up (optionally sent to admins)
- `admin.report` = A new report has been filed

**Returns:** [GroupedNotificationsResults](#GroupedNotificationsResults)\
**OAuth:** User token + `read:notifications`\
**Version history:**\
4.3.0 - added

#### Request

##### Headers

Authorization
: {{<required>}} Provide this header with `Bearer <user token>` to gain authorized access to this API method.

##### Query parameters

max_id
: String. All results returned will be about notifications strictly older than this notification ID. In effect, sets an upper bound on results.

since_id
: String. All results returned will be about notifications strictly newer than this notification ID. In effect, sets a lower bound on results.

min_id
: String. Returns results about notifications immediately newer than this notification ID. In effect, sets a cursor at this ID and paginates forward.

limit
: Integer. Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to 40 notifications. Max 80 notification groups.

types[]
: Array of String. Types to include in the result.

exclude_types[]
: Array of String. Types to exclude from the results.

account_id
: String. Return only notifications received from the specified account.

expand_accounts
: String. One of `full` (default) or `partial_avatars`. When set to `partial_avatars`, some accounts will not be rendered in full in the returned `accounts` list but will be instead returned in stripped-down form in the `partial_accounts` list. The most recent account in a notification group is always rendered in full in the `accounts` attribute.

grouped_types[]
: Array of String. Restrict which notification types can be grouped. Use this if there are notification types for which your client does not support grouping. If omitted, the server will group notifications of all types it supports (currently, `favourite` and `reblog`). If you do not want any notification grouping, use [GET `/api/v1/notifications`]({{< relref "methods/notifications#get" >}}) instead.

## Get the number of unread notifications {#unread-group-count}

```http
GET /api/v2_alpha/notifications/unread_count HTTP/1.1
```

Get the (capped) number of unread notification groups for the current user.
A notification is considered unread if it is more recent than the [notifications read marker]({{< relref "methods/markers" >}}).
Because the count is dependant on the parameters, it is computed every time and is thus a relatively slow operation (although faster than getting the full corresponding notifications), therefore the number of returned notifications is capped.

**Returns:** Hash with a single key of `count`\
**OAuth:** User token + `read:notifications`\
**Version history**:\
