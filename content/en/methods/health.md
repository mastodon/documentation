## Get basic health status as JSON {#get}

Check on the state of the web process for the Mastodon instance. This is useful for simple monitoring. The endpoint checks that the web process responds to requests. It also checks that it can successfully connect to the database, and to the cache.

Responses other than HTTP 200 should be interpreted as some element of the web process not being healthy.
