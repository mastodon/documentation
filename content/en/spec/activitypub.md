## Status federation {#status}

{{< caption-link url="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/app/lib/activitypub/activity.rb" caption="app/lib/activitypub/activity.rb" >}}

### Supported activities for statuses

* Create = transformed into a status and saved into database
* Delete = removes a status from the database
* Like = transformed into a favourite on a status
* Announce = transformed into a boost on a status
* Flag = transformed into a report to the moderation team.
* Update = only supported on polls. Used to refresh vote count.
* Undo = undo a previous Like or Announce.

### Payloads

The first-class Object types supported by Mastodon are `Note` and `Question`.

* Notes are transformed into regular statuses.
* Questions are transformed into a poll status.

Some other Object types are converted as best as possible. The transformer uses `content` if available, or `name` if not, in order to generate status text. The `url` will be appended. The `summary` property will be used as the CW text.

* Article
* Page
* Image
* Audio
* Video
* Event

## Profile federation {#profile}

### Supported activities for profiles

* Follow = Indicate interest in receiving status updates from a profile.
* Accept/Reject = used to approve or deny Follow activities. Unlocked accounts will automatically reply with an Accept, while locked accounts can manually choose whether to approve or deny a follow request.
* Add/Remove = manage pinned posts and featured collections.
* Block = Signal to a remote server that they should hide your profile from that user. Not guaranteed.
* Flag = report user
* Update = refresh account details
* Move = migrate followers from one account to another. Requires alsoKnownAs to be set in both directions.
* Delete = remove an account from the database, as well as all of their statuses.
* Undo = undo a previous Follow, Accept Follow, or Block.

## HTML sanitization {#sanitization}

{{< caption-link url="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/app/lib/sanitize_config.rb" caption="app/lib/sanitize\_config.rb" >}}

 Mastodon sanitizes incoming HTML in order to not break assumptions for API client developers. Supported elements include `<p>`, `<span>`, `<br>`, and `<a>`. Unsupported elements will be converted to `<p>`.The sanitizer will keep classes if they begin with microformats prefixes or are semantic classes:

* h-\*
* p-\*
* u-\*
* dt-\*
* e-\*
* mention
* hashtag
* ellipsis
* invisible

## JSON-LD Namespacing {#namespaces}

## Extensions

### Public key {#publicKey}

Public keys are used for HTTPS Signatures and Linked Data Signatures. This is implemented using an extra property `publicKey` on actor objects. See [Security](security.md) for more information. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://w3id.org/security/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://mastodon.social/users/Gargron",
  "type": "Person",
  "publicKey": {
    "id": "https://mastodon.social/users/Gargron#main-key",
    "owner": "https://mastodon.social/users/Gargron",
    "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAvXc4vkECU2/CeuSo1wtn\nFoim94Ne1jBMYxTZ9wm2YTdJq1oiZKif06I2fOqDzY/4q/S9uccrE9Bkajv1dnkO\nVm31QjWlhVpSKynVxEWjVBO5Ienue8gND0xvHIuXf87o61poqjEoepvsQFElA5ym\novljWGSA/jpj7ozygUZhCXtaS2W5AD5tnBQUpcO0lhItYPYTjnmzcc4y2NbJV8hz\n2s2G8qKv8fyimE23gY1XrPJg+cRF+g4PqFXujjlJ7MihD9oqtLGxbu7o1cifTn3x\nBfIdPythWu5b4cujNsB3m3awJjVmx+MHQ9SugkSIYXV0Ina77cTNS0M2PYiH1PFR\nTwIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
  }
}
```

### Featured collection {#featured}

What is known in Mastodon as “pinned toots”, or statuses that are always featured at the top of people’s profiles, is implemented using an extra property `featured` on the actor object that points to a `Collection` of objects. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "featured": {
        "@id": "toot:featured",
        "@type": "@id"
      }
    }
  ],

  "id": "https://example.com/@alice",
  "type": "Person",
  "featured": "https://example.com/@alice/collections/featured"
}
```

### Custom emojis {#emoji}

Mastodon supports arbitrary emojis, that is, small images uploaded by admins and invokable via shortcodes. For this, an `Emoji` type is used. These emojis are listed in the `tag` property just like `Mention` and `Hashtag` objects, since they are entities that affect how the text is rendered. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "Emoji": "toot:Emoji"
    }
  ],

  "id": "https://example.com/@alice/hello-world",
  "type": "Note",
  "content": "Hello world :kappa:",
  "tag": [
    {
      "id": "https://example.com/emoji/123",
      "type": "Emoji",
      "name": ":kappa:",
      "icon": {
        "type": "Image",
        "mediaType": "image/png",
        "url": "https://example.com/files/kappa.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Focal points {#focalPoint}

Mastodon supports setting a focal point on uploaded images, so that wherever that image is displayed, the focal point stays in view. This is implemented using an extra property `focalPoint` on `Image` objects. The property is simply an array of two floating points between -1.0 and 1.0, with 0,0 being the center of the image, the first value being x \(-1.0 is the left edge, +1.0 is the right edge\) and the second value being y \(-1.0 is the bottom edge, +1.0 is the top edge\). See [Focal points](../methods/statuses/media.md#focal-points) for more information. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "focalPoint": {
        "@container": "@list",
        "@id": "toot:focalPoint"
      }
    }
  ],

  "id": "https://example.com/@alice/hello-world",
  "type": "Note",
  "content": "A picture attached!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Image",
      "mediaType": "image/png",
      "url": "https://example.com/files/cats.png",
      "focalPoint": [
        -0.55,
        0.43
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Blurhash {#blurhash}

Mastodon generates colorful preview thumbnails for attachments. This is implemented using an extra property `blurhash` on `Image` objects. The property is a string generated by the [BlurHash algorithm](https://blurha.sh). Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "blurhash": "toot:blurhash"
    }
  ],

  "id": "https://example.com/@alice/hello-world",
  "type": "Note",
  "content": "A picture attached!",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "Image",
      "mediaType": "image/png",
      "url": "https://example.com/files/cats.png",
      "blurhash": "UBL_:rOpGG-oBUNG,qRj2so|=eE1w^n4S5NH"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Profile metadata {#PropertyValue}

Mastodon supports arbitrary profile fields containing name-value pairs. This is implemented using the `attachment` property on actor objects, with objects in the array having a type of `PropertyValue` and a `value` property, both from the schema.org namespace. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "PropertyValue": "schema:PropertyValue",
      "value": "schema:value"
    }
  ],
  "id": "https://mastodon.social/users/Gargron",
  "type": "Person",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Patreon",
      "value": "<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/mastodon\" rel=\"me nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"\">patreon.com/mastodon</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span}"
    },
    {
      "type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Homepage",
      "value": "<a href=\"https://zeonfederated.com\" rel=\"me nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"\">zeonfederated.com</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Identity proofs {#IdentityProof}

Mastodon supports integration with identity providers to prove that a profile is linked to a certain identity. This is implemented using the `attachment` property on actor objects, with objects in the array having a type of `IdentityProof` from the Mastodon namespace. The object also includes `signatureAlgorithm` and `signatureValue` from the W3ID Security Vocabulary namespace. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "IdentityProof": "toot:IdentityProof"
    }
  ],
  "id": "https://mastodon.social/users/Gargron",
  "type": "Person",
  "attachment": [
    {
      "type": "IdentityProof",
      "name": "gargron",
      "signatureAlgorithm": "keybase",
      "signatureValue": "5cfc20c7018f2beefb42a68836da59a792e55daa4d118498c9b1898de7e845690f"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Discoverability flag {#discoverable}

Mastodon allows users to opt-in or opt-out of discoverability features like the profile directory. This flag may also be used as an indicator of the user's preferences toward being included in external discovery services, such as search engines or other indexing tools. If you are implementing such a tool, it is recommended that you respect this property if it is present. This is implemented using an extra property `discoverable` on objects. Example:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "toot": "http://joinmastodon.org/ns#",
      "discoverable": "toot:discoverable"
    }
  ],
  "id": "https://mastodon.social/users/Gargron",
  "type": "Person",
  "discoverable": true
}
```
