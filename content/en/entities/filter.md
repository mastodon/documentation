## Implementation notes

If `whole_word` is true , client app should do:

* Define ‘word constituent character’ for your app. In the official implementation, it’s `[A-Za-z0-9_]` in JavaScript, and `[[:word:]]` in Ruby. Ruby uses the POSIX character class \(Letter \| Mark \| Decimal\_Number \| Connector\_Punctuation\).
* If the phrase starts with a word character, and if the previous character before matched range is a word character, its matched range should be treated to not match.
* If the phrase ends with a word character, and if the next character after matched range is a word character, its matched range should be treated to not match.
